## Technology Stack
- **Node.js** with **Express** for building the server-side application.
- **MongoDB** with **Prisma** as the ORM to manage database operations.
- Custom error handling using `next(new ApiError(errorCode, 'message'))`.


## Custom error handling

We are using custom error for the project that is:
```javascript
app.get('/example', (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        // Your logic here
    } catch (error) {
        next(new ApiError(500, 'Internal Server Error'));
    }
});
